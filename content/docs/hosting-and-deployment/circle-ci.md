## TODO: Test a Circle CI Setup

I had thought Cumbria IO might be a good candidate for Circle CI testing, but Circle CI... may not have support for GitLab. Certainly not free for private repos. So the question... do I want Cumbria IO to remain a private repo? If so... no Circle CI.

So we'll leave that for some future project, maybe.
