## Pros

### Supports the Asset Pipeline

Forestry support all stable versions of Hugo and are quick to update with the latest available versions, including the extended versions, which means support for the Hugo asset pipeline: https://forestry.io/docs/faqs/hugo-version/

## Cons

### Won't Watch Repo

Forestry is not a continuous deployment solution. It won't watch your repo for changes, so builds will only occur when you create or edit content via the CMS.
