HugoModo is a collection of themes and extensions for the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator. The aim is to take the benefits of Hugo's incredible speed and flexibility, and to achieve the same comforts and conventions of other frameworks. HugoModo aims to make Hugo the best of both worlds.
